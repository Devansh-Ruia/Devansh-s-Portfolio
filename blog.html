        <p>Here’s where I write about various topics ranging from technology to philosophy.</p>
        <p>If you enjoy deep thoughts interrupted by occasional pop culture metaphors, this blog’s for you. Read on for life’s important questions, like "Is AI Music harmony or disruption?" and "What is the point of Riddler Trophies in Batman Arkham games?"</p>

            <li><strong>Theory of Knowledge (TOK) Exhibition:</strong> My TOK exhibition was a philosophical journey that featured three objects: an ancient sundial, a Pascal calculator, and an ancient world map (though they weren’t physically available). With limited space—just two school tables joined together—I aimed to show how these objects connected to knowledge and its impact on the world. It was an exciting challenge to engage an audience that wasn’t very familiar with Theory of Knowledge!</li>
    
            <li><strong>Random Musings:</strong> You’ll also find my thoughts on everything from economics and technology to why I am bad at Call of Duty Warzone (it’s totally not my fault, I swear).</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            Stay tuned for more posts where I combine serious topics with a little humor and a dash of creativity!
