            <p>“Woof! Woof!” Max barked at the crack of dawn. And just like that, my dreams of peaceful sleep evaporated.</p>

            <p>Let me rewind a bit. Before Max entered my life, I had a very clear image of what dog ownership would be like: cuddles, cute photos for Instagram, and maybe the occasional walk in the park. I mean, how hard could it be? Dogs are adorable, loyal, and perfect for social media. Plus, who doesn't love the idea of having a furry companion always by your side, looking up at you with adoration?</p>

            <p>But... that’s not quite what I got. Max wasn’t just about cute selfies and wagging tails. There were walks (so many walks), early mornings, and more poop than I had ever anticipated. Seriously, no one warns you about the poop. Suddenly, I found myself waking up before the sun (who even knew 7 AM existed?) to make sure Max got his morning walk. And for what? For him to sniff every inch of the sidewalk without actually doing anything.            </p>

            <p>“Max, this isn’t a sightseeing tour,” I’d groan. But he didn’t care. He had a schedule, and I was just a minor character in his story.</p>

            <p>Adjusting to Max’s routine wasn’t easy. I used to have weekends filled with sleeping in and hanging out with friends. Now? I was the person responsible for making sure Max didn’t chew through another pair of shoes. (Spoiler: He still did.) It felt like I was raising a tiny, hairy toddler who was much too picky about where he wanted to pee.</p>
