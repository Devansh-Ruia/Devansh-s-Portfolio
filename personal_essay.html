            <p>“Woof! Woof!” Max barked at the crack of dawn, shattering my dreams of peaceful sleep.
            </p>

            <p>LBefore Max entered my life, I had a crystal-clear vision of what owning a dog would be like: cuddles, cute Instagram photos, and maybe the occasional walk in the park. How hard could it be? Dogs are adorable, loyal, and perfect for social media. Plus, who wouldn't love a furry companion always looking up at you with adoration?
            </p>

            <p>But things didn’t quite go as I imagined. Max wasn’t just about cute selfies and wagging tails. There were endless walks, early mornings, and way more poop than anyone had prepared me for. Seriously, no one warns you about that part. Suddenly, I found myself waking up before sunrise (did you know 7 AM existed?) to make sure Max got his morning walk. And for what? For him to sniff every inch of the sidewalk without actually doing anything.
            </p>

            <p>“Max, this isn’t a sightseeing tour,” I’d groan, but he didn’t care. He had a routine, and I was just a supporting character in his story.
            </p>

            <p>Adjusting to life with Max wasn’t exactly a smooth transition. Weekends once meant sleeping in and hanging out with friends. Now, I was the one making sure Max didn’t chew through another pair of shoes (spoiler: he did). It was like raising a tiny, hairy toddler who couldn’t make up his mind about where to pee.
            </p>
            <p>Somewhere between the early mornings and the dog-hair-covered clothes, I realized something had changed. I actually started to enjoy it. Sure, my friends were off enjoying their sleep-ins, but I was the one getting greeted with a happy, wagging tail every time I came home. Max became the family mascot, making us laugh with his goofy antics and giving us all a reason to gather around for our daily game of "Who can get Max to come when called?" (Spoiler: always me).</p>
            <p>Before Max, I thought owning a dog was all fun and games (and social media likes). After Max, I knew better. Owning a dog wasn’t about Instagram moments; it was about consistency, patience, and yes, dealing with more bites, scratches, and barks than I had bargained for. I had to learn how to manage my time better, take on new responsibilities, and adapt in ways I never expected. In return, Max taught me about loyalty, love, and how to handle a very stubborn dog on walks.
            </p>
            <p>Looking back, adopting Max changed more than just my daily routine. It gave me a new perspective on responsibility and balance, and it showed me what it really means to care for someone other than myself (even if that someone spends most of their time napping). As I head off to college, I know that the patience, responsibility, and time management skills I’ve learned from Max will help me tackle the next chapter of my life. If I can handle Max, I can handle anything — as long as it doesn’t involve waking up too early.
            </p>
            <p>Because let’s be honest — even Max doesn’t like waking up that early.</p>
