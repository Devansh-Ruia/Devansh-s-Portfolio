        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>
            Here’s where I show off my proudest achievements that will make you go "Wow, that’s impressive" (or at least I hope so):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physics Extended Essay:</strong> Ever wondered how a quantum particle behaves when you mess around with electric fields? My EE dives into this thrilling question: <em>"How does the magnitude of an applied electric field affect the probability density distribution of a quantum particle confined within a double potential well system, while keeping the well separation and well depth constant?"</em> It’s as cool as it sounds—trust me!</li>
    
            <li><strong>Physics IA:</strong> My Physics IA explores how the material bandgap in solar cell design affects electron tunneling efficiency through the energy barrier, while I keep other factors like temperature and light intensity constant. It's a solar-powered journey into quantum mechanics!</li>
    
            <li><strong>Math IA:</strong> I modeled the spread and containment of infectious diseases—because why not use math to stop a pandemic? Whether you're into calculus or epidemiology, this IA has it all.</li>
    
            <li><strong>Chemistry IA:</strong> Ever thought about how solar cells absorb light? My Chemistry IA investigates how the chemical composition of dyes in solar cells can be tweaked to improve absorption efficiency across the solar spectrum. It's bright, colorful, and packed with chemistry goodness!</li>
    
            <li><strong>Economics Macro IA:</strong> What happens when there’s a labor shortage and rising wages in New Zealand? My Economics IA dives into the impact of these challenges on New Zealand’s economy—graphs, numbers, and analysis galore!</li>
    
            <li><strong>Research Paper on Virtual Reality:</strong> In a world where VR might just replace classrooms, I asked the big question: How do virtual reality educational games affect users? Spoiler alert: It’s more than just fun and games—it’s the future of learning.</li>
    
            <li><strong>Model United Nations (MUN) Adventures:</strong> As the chair of the Historical UNSC and a proud MUN nerd, I’ve helped keep world peace (at least in simulated meetings). I’ve also had heated debates about fictional invasions, which is probably more intense than it sounds.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            If you’re still reading, congratulations! You’ve made it through my academic adventures, and no, I don’t just write these things to impress people (though that’s a bonus).
